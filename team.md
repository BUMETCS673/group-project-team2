## Taina Conde

Hi everyone! My name is Taina and I'm currently enrolled on the MSSD program. I graduated in Economics and Law in Brazil, but I wasn't passionate about any of them. I decided to give Programming a try and I ended up enjoying it more than I expected. I've been coding individually on my own projects for the past two years. I'm excited to work as a team in our project this semester. In my free time, my husband and I love to explore NYC and travel.

## Benoît Clemenceau

Hello everyone! My name is Benoît Clemenceau, I come from Paris, France, and I have been in Boston since January. I am doing the MS in Computer Information Systems and not following any specific concentration. This is my first online class. I come from a French Engineering school named ECE Paris and I am here thanks to a double degree program I managed to get in. I studied Mathematics, Physics, Electronics, and Informatics there. I learned C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python, and did a bunch of Data Science and Machine Learning. The technology I am most comfortable with is JavaScript, especially with React. I have done a couple of internships and freelancing in Java, JavaScript, React, React Native, and Kotlin. My last side-project was building a web portfolio/blog in React with Next.js, you can check it out live here: [benclem.dev](https://benclem.dev/)
