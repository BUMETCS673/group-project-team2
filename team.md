## Taina Conde

Hi everyone! My name is Taina and I'm currently enrolled on the MSSD program. I graduated in Economics and Law in Brazil, but I wasn't passionate about any of them. I decided to give Programming a try and I ended up enjoying it more than I expected. I've been coding individually on my own projects for the past two years. I'm excited to work as a team in our project this semester. In my free time, my husband and I love to explore NYC and travel.
